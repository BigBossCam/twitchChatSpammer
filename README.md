# twitchChatSpammer
Self explanatory title, spams a keyword, then adds the same keyword to itself to avoid "same message cannot be sent for 30 seconds" error in twitch. Automatically breaks at 500 chars (twitch chat limit). 

Note: Must have browser focused on stream and ready to type on chat!

usage: run script -> enter keyword -> enter iterations -> countdown -> go!

requires: pynput
`pip install pynput`

Enjoy.
